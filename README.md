Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field of study that empowers machines with the ability to interpret and understand visual information from the world. 
It encompasses the development of algorithms, models, and systems that enable computers to gain insights from images, videos, or any visual data.

The primary goal of computer vision is to replicate and extend the capabilities of human vision, allowing machines to comprehend and extract meaningful information from visual input. This field draws inspiration from various disciplines, including computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, neuroscience, and psychology.

Key components of computer vision include:

Image Acquisition and Processing: Computer vision begins with the acquisition of visual data through cameras, sensors, or other devices. Image processing techniques are then applied to enhance, filter, or transform the raw visual input.

Feature Extraction: Algorithms are designed to identify and extract relevant features from images. These features could include edges, shapes, textures, or more complex patterns.

Object Recognition and Classification: Computer vision systems aim to recognize and categorize objects within images or videos. This involves training models to associate specific patterns or features with known objects.

Scene Understanding: Beyond recognizing individual objects, computer vision seeks to understand the broader context of a scene. This includes relationships between objects, spatial information, and contextual interpretation.

3D Reconstruction: Some applications of computer vision involve reconstructing three-dimensional representations of objects or scenes. This is essential for tasks such as robotics, augmented reality, and medical imaging.

Machine Learning in Computer Vision: With the advent of machine learning, particularly deep learning, computer vision has experienced significant advancements. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning architectures have proven highly effective in tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
